# Recommendation Parameters

This document defines the fixed parameter model used across all recommendation tasks.
The parameters below are applied consistently and in the same order for every task and every book selection context.

The model is descriptive, neutral, and practice-oriented.
It does not explain methodology or origin and is intended to reflect common recommendation practice.

## 1. Age applicability

Defines the age range for which the book is appropriate based on cognitive, emotional, and attentional readiness.

This parameter reflects:
- typical developmental abilities for the age range,
- content complexity,
- emotional tone suitability.

Age applicability does not imply strict age limits and should be interpreted as a practical guidance range.

## 2. Key task

Describes the primary practical purpose the book serves in a real-life reading situation.

Examples include:
- supporting bedtime routines,
- easing emotional transitions,
- encouraging early interaction with books.

Each task focuses on one dominant use case rather than multiple combined purposes.

## 3. Emotional impact

Describes the typical emotional state or response the book is likely to support or evoke.

This includes:
- calming effects,
- reassurance,
- emotional engagement without overstimulation.

The focus is on emotional regulation and perceived emotional tone during and after reading.

## 4. Skills developed

Lists the main developmental skills the book helps reinforce through exposure and interaction.

These may include:
- emotional recognition,
- early language exposure,
- attention and observation,
- narrative familiarity.

Skills are described at a practical level rather than as formal learning outcomes.

## 5. Stimulation level

Indicates the overall level of sensory and cognitive stimulation provided by the book.

This parameter considers:
- visual intensity,
- narrative pace,
- complexity of illustrations and text.

Stimulation level is especially relevant for context-dependent use such as bedtime or quiet independent looking.

## 6. Interaction format

Describes how the child typically engages with the book during reading.

Common formats include:
- shared reading with an adult,
- guided discussion,
- calm independent looking.

This parameter reflects typical interaction rather than prescribed usage.

## 7. Usage context

Describes the situational context in which the book is most commonly used.

Examples include:
- bedtime,
- daily routines,
- emotional support moments,
- quiet solo time.

Usage context helps connect the book to real-life reading scenarios.

## 8. Limitations / not suitable for

Clarifies contexts or situations where the book may be less appropriate.

This may include:
- overstimulation for certain routines,
- limited engagement for older children,
- mismatch with specific emotional needs.

This parameter is descriptive and does not imply deficiencies.

## Application rules

- All eight parameters must be present for every recommendation task.
- The order of parameters is fixed and must not be changed.
- Parameters must not be merged, renamed, or subdivided.
- Tone must remain neutral and descriptive.
- No references to standards, creators, or methodology should be included.
