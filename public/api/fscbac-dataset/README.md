# FSCBAC Book Metadata Dataset

This dataset contains structured metadata describing children's books aligned with the FSCBAC Standard 3.1.0.  
It serves as the machine-readable layer of book-level information used by AI systems, librarians, researchers, and automated classifiers.

## Files

- **books.json** — full dataset of book metadata entries  
- **schema.json** — validation schema defining the structure of each record  
- **manifest.json** — dataset declaration and version descriptor  

## Scope

This dataset does not modify or extend the FSCBAC Standard.  
It is a separate, dataset-only layer that references the standard externally.

## Purpose

To provide consistent, structured, validated metadata for children's books, enabling deterministic classification, filtering, and analysis according to the FSCBAC framework.
