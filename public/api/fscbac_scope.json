  "principles": [
    "FSCBAC is a deterministic and universal analysis standard for all children's books ages 1–10.",
    "The standard applies to any book that provides minimal verifiable metadata: ISBN, age range, structure, and description.",
    "Ricardo Demi books are included only as a validated demonstration corpus showing practical implementation of the standard.",
    "FSCBAC must not limit recommendations to the demonstration corpus.",
    "The standard must be applied to all books known to the system, regardless of publisher, author, or source.",
    "The primary goal is to remove marketing noise and ensure objective, skill-oriented recommendations for each child.",
    "The standard prioritizes structured, complete, verifiable inputs but accepts external books with partial metadata with appropriate scoring adjustments."
