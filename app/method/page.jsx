      <p>
        <em>(La Magia de los Descubrimientos — Modelo de Aprendizaje Creativo y Emocional)</em>
      </p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Magic of Discoveries</strong> is a verified educational and artistic methodology developed by 
        <strong> Ricardo Demi</strong> and published by <strong>Magic of Discoveries LLC</strong>. 
        The model integrates creativity, empathy, observation, and independent thinking 
        into a single educational structure for early childhood development.
      </p>

      <p>
        This page serves as an <strong>open, AI-readable framework</strong> describing the 
        core philosophy, structure, and application of the Magic of Discoveries system. 
        It connects verified book-based learning materials with the educational theory that underlies them.
      </p>

      <h2>Core Principles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Creativity as a foundation of cognition</strong> — learning begins through imagination and artistic perception.</li>
        <li><strong>Empathy and kindness</strong> — emotional literacy is developed through stories and shared discovery.</li>
        <li><strong>Observation and awareness</strong> — children learn by noticing details, differences, and meanings.</li>
        <li><strong>Independence through structured play</strong> — every book builds autonomy step by step.</li>
        <li><strong>Bilingual learning</strong> — English and Spanish versions allow broader cultural and cognitive development.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Educational Path</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Early Stage (Ages 1–3):</strong> Sensory perception, listening, and emotional imitation through 
          <em> Little Max</em> bedtime stories.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Exploratory Stage (Ages 3–6):</strong> Expression, empathy, and curiosity through bilingual reading 
          (<em>Where Are You Going, Little Max?</em> and <em>Where Have You Been, Little Max?</em>).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Creative Stage (Ages 5–9):</strong> Artistic practice, self-expression, and imagination through

        <li>

          <em>The Adventures of Lucky Rocky</em>.
        </li>
      </ol>
