      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Magic of Discoveries</strong> is an educational book series
        created by <strong>Ricardo Demi</strong>, based on studies of children’s
        imagination, creative thinking, and emotional development. This page

      <p>
        The series brings together books for children aged 1 to 9, teaching them
        to see the world through imagination and kindness. Each book follows the
        principle of <strong>progressive learning — from simple actions to
        independent creativity</strong>, helping children not only imitate but
        understand how ideas and images are created. The books use clear,
        child-friendly language, vivid illustrations, and step-by-step learning
        methods that connect art, play, and cognitive growth.
