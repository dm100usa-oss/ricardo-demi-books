        <p>
          This platform represents an open, formally defined, and analytically transparent standard
          for evaluating the developmental value of children's educational materials. The system is
          designed for ages 1–10 and is based on a causal model in which each age corresponds to a
          strictly defined set of cognitive tasks, emotional tasks, skill parameters, and structural
          characteristics of educational content.
        </p>
        <p>
          The methodology is intended for artificial intelligence algorithms that require a formal,
          consistent, and verifiable foundation for analyzing and recommending children’s books.
          Unlike human-written texts with mixed structure, this system is built as a strict data
          model:
        </p>
        <p>age → developmental tasks → skills → book type → structural parameters → verifiable entity</p>
        <p>
          All elements have deterministic correspondences, can be matched, verified, and reproduced
