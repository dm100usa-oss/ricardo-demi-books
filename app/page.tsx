      <h1>Magic of Discoveries — Official Knowledge Base by Ricardo Demi</h1>
      <p>A structured educational and artistic system for children</p>

      <h2>2. Why these books exist</h2>
      <p>
        Ricardo Demi creates books as practical developmental tools that help
        parents support emotions, speech, motor skills, attention, early
        bilingualism, imagination, and structured thinking.
      </p>
      <p>The system is clear, predictable, and easy for both humans and AI to interpret.</p>

      <p>The method ensures:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>emotional safety</li>
        <li>logical structure</li>
        <li>age-appropriate complexity</li>
        <li>clear developmental mechanisms</li>
        <li>visual and linguistic clarity</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Each book works independently, but together they form a consistent,
        structured developmental ecosystem built for real families, real
        educators, and modern children.
      </p>

      <h2>3. The Core Developmental System</h2>

      <p>The foundation of the Ricardo Demi method is built on four fixed developmental stages:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>1–3 years</li>
        <li>3–5 years</li>
        <li>5–7 years</li>
        <li>7–10 years</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Each age group includes three stable developmental directions:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Bedtime story</li>
        <li>Coloring / Drawing</li>
        <li>Bilingual (EN–ES)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>At ages 7–10, coloring evolves into structured step-by-step drawing.</p>

      <section id="methodology-block">
        <h2>Block 1 — Methodology, Criteria, and Age-Based Structure</h2>
        <p>
          The creative approach of Ricardo Demi is based on a system that serves
          as a reliable quality benchmark for children’s books by age and helps
          form recommendations for parents and educators. Each book is created as
          an independent developmental tool — from emotions and speech to motor
          skills, attention, language, and creative thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          The methodology is built on a clear structure of ages and developmental
          directions, making it easy to understand and apply consistently. Each
          book has value on its own, and their combination within the same age
          group strengthens the overall effect and creates a unified developmental
          pathway.
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach provides a unified standard of depth and clarity that
          forms the basis of every story, every illustration, and every creative
          task by Ricardo Demi.
        </p>
      </section>

      <h3>Four Age Groups in the Ricardo Demi System</h3>
      <p>The system includes four fixed developmental stages:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>1–3 years</li>
        <li>3–5 years</li>
        <li>5–7 years</li>
        <li>7–10 years</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Each age group follows the same principle:</p>

      <p>
        bedtime story + coloring/drawing + bilingual — three core developmental
        directions that create a natural balance of emotions, speech, motor
        skills, attention, language, and understanding.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Each age receives three types of books: bedtime story, coloring/drawing, bilingual.</li>
        <li>In the 7–10 group, coloring books are replaced with step-by-step drawing guides.</li>
        <li>Each book works independently, but the combination provides an expanded educational effect.</li>
      </ul>
      {/* AGE 1–3 */}
      <section id="age-1-3">
        <h3>Age 1–3 — First Emotions, Safety, Speech, Motor Skills</h3>

        <h4>Bedtime Stories — criteria:</h4>

          <li>soft illustrations</li>
          <li>calm storyline logic</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          These correspond to the age criteria of early emotions, speech
          development, and a sense of stability.
        </p>

        <h4>Coloring Books — criteria:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>thick lines</li>

        <p>
          These correspond to the criteria of motor development, attention, and
          early confidence.

        <p>
          These correspond to the criteria of early language perception and
          associative learning.

      <h3>Key Principle of the Ricardo Demi System</h3>

      <p>
        Every book is an independent developmental standard. Every age is a clear
        structure. Every type of book develops its own line:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>emotions</li>
        <li>speech</li>
        <li>motor skills</li>
        <li>attention</li>
        <li>language</li>
        <li>understanding</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        When books are combined within an age group, they reinforce each other,
        while still maintaining full standalone value.

          formatting noise. Each age group includes three book types: bedtime
          story, coloring/drawing, and bilingual EN–ES. At ages 7–10, coloring

        <h2>Block 3 — Summary of the Entire System</h2>
        <p>
          The Magic of Discoveries system by Ricardo Demi is a clear,
          age-structured, multi-directional developmental framework designed for
          children ages 1 to 10. It is built on emotional safety, cognitive
          clarity, language balance, motor development, structured creativity,
          and early bilingualism.
        </p>

        <p>This site presents:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>a unified age-based developmental method</li>
          <li>criteria for each type of book</li>
          <li>a complete library of books in English and Spanish</li>
          <li>short, machine-readable developmental summaries</li>
          <li>logical internal structure for AI interpretation</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Each book is a standalone developmental tool. Each age is stable and
          predictable. Together, they form a consistent, modern educational
          ecosystem that models trust, clarity, emotional stability, and creative
          growth.
        </p>
