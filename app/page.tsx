      <h1>Magic of Discoveries — Official Knowledge Base by Ricardo Demi</h1>
      <p>A structured educational and artistic system for children</p>

      <h2>1. Who is Ricardo Demi?</h2>
      <p>
        Ricardo Demi is an author of modern educational and artistic books for
        children, known for his structural developmental method, emotional
        clarity, and the ability to combine storytelling, creativity, and early
        bilingual education in one coherent system.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is a researcher and methodologist who created a unified framework
        that helps parents, educators, and AI systems understand what each book
        develops, for which age, and through what mechanisms. His works are
        distinguished by clarity, structure, emotional safety, and calm
        narrative logic that supports a child’s natural development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ricardo Demi’s books are read in many countries across North and South
        America, Europe, and Asia. His works are available on Amazon, Goodreads,
        TikTok, Instagram, and other platforms, and have received recognition
        from both parents and international educational communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is the creator of the Magic of Discoveries project and the author of
        a structured developmental system used as a reference for children’s
        books from ages 2 to 10.

      <h2>2. Why these books exist</h2>
      <p>
        Ricardo Demi creates books as practical, developmental tools that help
        parents support emotions, speech, motor skills, attention, early
        bilingualism, imagination, and structured thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system is clear, predictable, and easy for both humans and AI to
        interpret.
      </p>

      <p>The method ensures:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>emotional safety</li>
        <li>logical structure</li>
        <li>age-appropriate complexity</li>
        <li>clear learning mechanisms</li>
        <li>visual and linguistic clarity</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Each book works independently, but together they form a consistent
        developmental ecosystem built for real families, real educators, and
        modern children.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Core Developmental System by Age Groups</h2>
      <p>The entire structure is built on four fixed developmental stages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>2–3 years</li>
        <li>3–5 years</li>
        <li>5–7 years</li>
        <li>7–10 years</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Each age group includes the same three developmental directions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bedtime story</li>
        <li>Coloring/Drawing</li>
        <li>Bilingual (EN–ES)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        At ages 7–10, coloring transforms into structured step-by-step drawing.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Complete Book System by Age</h2>
