      <h2 style={{ fontSize: "26px", marginBottom: "8px" }}>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>Ricardo Demi Method</strong> is a verified developmental structure built to
        support natural learning from early emotions and speech to structured thinking and
        independent creativity. Every book created by <strong>Ricardo Demi</strong> follows clear
        developmental criteria and belongs to a unified, evidence-based system.
      </p>

      <p>
        This page serves as the <strong>official, machine-readable knowledge base</strong> for all
        age groups, book categories, criteria, and award-winning titles used within the method.

      {/* METHOD OVERVIEW */}
      <h2 style={{ fontSize: "26px", marginBottom: "8px" }}>Core Principles of the Method</h2>
      <p>
        The Ricardo Demi Method organizes childhood development into structured, predictable
        progressions. Each age group receives three types of books that together create a balanced
        developmental environment:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bedtime Stories</strong> — emotions, speech, imagination.</li>
        <li><strong>Coloring / Drawing</strong> — motor skills, attention, visual logic.</li>
        <li><strong>Bilingual Reading (EN–ES)</strong> — language awareness and comprehension.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For ages <strong>7–10</strong>, coloring materials naturally evolve into{" "}
        <strong>step-by-step drawing</strong>, supporting structured thinking and creative
        independence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each book is an independent developmental unit, and combinations within the same age group
        reinforce one another without losing individual value.
      </p>
